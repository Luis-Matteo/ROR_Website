## Overview

In the latest build, I've added multiple themes support, finally, you can switch themes with just one command.

<p class="note">This is an experimental feature and may change until the feature stabilizes.</p>

## Installing Themes

The AMSF framework ships a default theme [Curtana](https://github.com/sparanoid/amsf-curtana). You can also install as many themes as you like and switch to the one you prefer in any time.

First find an AMSF theme (Curtana, for example), download the package and uncompress all files to `_amsf/themes` directory, the file structure should look like:

```
├── _amsf/ (Almace Scaffolding cache directory)
|   ├── themes/
|   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   └── assets/
|   |   |   └── includes/
|   |   |   └── layouts/
|   |   |   └── pages/
|   |   |   └── config.yml
└── _app/
```

Then execute the following command:


```sh
$ grunt switch --theme=curtana
```

You current theme will be backed up to `_amsf/themes/your-old-theme/` and the new theme `curtana` will be installed to the appropriate directories.

## Upgrading Themes

You can update your current theme by the following command:

```sh
$ grunt theme-upgrade
```

Please note that only the activated theme will be updated.

## Creating Your Own Theme

You can create your own theme in AMSF, theme files are located in the following location (I use default theme Curtana here for better understanding):

```
├── _app/
|   ├── _data/
|   |   └── curtana.yml
|   ├── _includes/
|   |   └── themes/
|   |   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   |   └── includes/
|   |   |   |   └── layouts/
|   ├── _pages/
|   |   └── themes/
|   |   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   |   └── example-page.md
|   |   |   |   └── ...
|   ├── assets/
|   |   └── themes/
|   |   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   |   └── _js/
|   |   |   |   └── _less/
|   |   |   |   └── ...
```

The theme specific config `curtana.yml` should have the same filename as your theme name. It should contain theme specific variables and can also override AMSF built-in settings.

More info about theme structure you can check out my default theme [Curtana](https://github.com/sparanoid/amsf-curtana).

You can also have multiple themes in your project, as many as you like. For example if you have themes Bootstrap and Ghost installed, the file structure should be:

```
├── _app/
|   ├── _data/
|   |   └── bootstrap.yml
|   |   └── curtana.yml
|   |   └── ghost.yml
|   ├── _includes/
|   |   └── themes/
|   |   |   └── bootstrap/
|   |   |   |   └── includes/
|   |   |   |   └── layouts/
|   |   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   |   └── includes/
|   |   |   |   └── layouts/
|   |   |   └── ghost/
|   |   |   |   └── includes/
|   |   |   |   └── layouts/
|   ├── _pages/
|   |   └── themes/
|   |   |   └── bootstrap/
|   |   |   |   └── example-about.md
|   |   |   |   └── example-blog.md
|   |   |   |   └── example-fluid-container.md
|   |   |   |   └── ...
|   |   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   |   └── example-page.md
|   |   |   |   └── ...
|   |   |   └── ghost/
|   |   |   |   └── example-archive.md
|   |   |   |   └── example-page.md
|   |   |   |   └── example-tagcloud.md
|   |   |   |   └── ...
|   ├── assets/
|   |   └── themes/
|   |   |   └── bootstrap/
|   |   |   |   └── _coffee/
|   |   |   |   └── _less/
|   |   |   |   └── images/
|   |   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   |   └── _js/
|   |   |   |   └── _less/
|   |   |   |   └── svg/
|   |   |   └── ghost/
|   |   |   |   └── _js/
|   |   |   |   └── _scss/
|   |   |   |   └── fonts/
...
```

### AMSF Options

There're several built-in options you can use in your theme. These options can also be overridden in theme specific config.

#### `site.name`

Template:

```html
<footer class="footer">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">{{ "{{ site.name " }}}}</a></li>
    <li><a href="/atom.xml">Atom</a></li>
  </ul>
</footer>
```

Output:

```html
<footer class="footer">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Almace Scaffolding</a></li>
    <li><a href="/atom.xml">Atom</a></li>
  </ul>
</footer>
```

#### `site.description`

Site description, will appear in the document meta and Atom feed subtitle.

Template:

```html
<meta property="og:description" content="{{ '{{ site.description ' }}}}">
```

Output:

```html
<meta property="og:description" content="Super-fast Jekyll framework">
```

#### `site.base`

Base URL, this is useful when you need to build site in a subdirectory (like GitHub Pages for Projects), it provides a specific URL prefix, for example, if the production site URL is http://sparanoid.com/lab/amsf/, set `base` to `/lab/amsf`, without trailing slash. This make sure all the links are relative to current site root (in a subdirectory in this case), you should use this variable for **every** link appeared in your theme.

Config:

```yaml
base: /lab/amsf
```

Template:

```html
<a href="{{ '{{ site.base ' }}}}/atom.xml">Atom</a>
```

Output:

```html
<a href="/lab/amsf/atom.xml">Atom</a>
```

#### `site.file`

Media assets URL used in posts, without trailing slash. In the most cases this URL should be powered by a CDN provider.

Config:

```yaml
file: //d349cztnlupsuf.cloudfront.net
```

Template:

```html
<img src="{{ '{{ site.file ' }}}}/post-thumbnail.jpg">
```

Output:

```html
<img src="//d349cztnlupsuf.cloudfront.net/post-thumbnail.jpg">
```

#### `site.twitter`

Site Twitter account handle.

Template:

```html
<a src="http://twitter.com/{{ '{{ site.twitter ' }}}}">Follow @{{ '{{ site.twitter ' }}}} on Twitter</a>
```

Output:

```html
<a src="http://twitter.com/sparanoid">Follow @sparanoid on Twitter</a>
```

#### `site.force_utf_8`

Force UTF-8 encoding, enable this will simply add `<meta charset=utf-8>` to the head of your pages.

Template:

```html
{{ '{% if site.force_utf_8 ' }}%}
  <meta charset=utf-8>
{{ '{% endif ' }}%}
```

## Publishing Themes

You really like your custom design and wanna show it off to the world? Cool, you can create (pack) you own theme by the following command:

```sh
$ grunt theme-save
```

The activated theme will be save to AMSF cache (`_amsf/`) with correct file and directory structure, then you can upload your theme to GitHub.

Still confusing? see my default theme [Curtana](https://github.com/sparanoid/amsf-curtana) for reference.
